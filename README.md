# Artificial Neural Networks and Deep Learning 2023 - First Homework
## Image Classification

Welcome to the first Homework of the Artificial Neural Networks and Deep Learning course! You have the opportunity to test what you learned during the course and to compete with your classmates! ðŸ˜Ž

In this homework, you are asked to classify plants (like the ones in the example image below) that are divided into two categories according to their state of health. It is a binary classification problem, so the goal is to predict the correct class label in {0, 1}.

You can find the dataset [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Nx9iHkF4EErSIl6xxQ6HQaa3lqpt0GmB/view?usp=sharing).

The dataset provided is structured in a single folder containing the following classes:
- Healthy : 3224 images
- Unhealthy : 1976 images

- The dataset contains in total 5200 images of size 96x96.

## Structure of the repository
The repository is structured in the following way:
- best_model.ipynb: notebook that generates the best model we were able to build.
- other_model: In the same file we also have other models that we tried.
- report.pdf: pdf file containing a brief recap of all our experiments before reaching the best model.
