# Artificial Neural Networks and Deep Learning 2023 - First Homework
## Image Classification

Welcome to the first Homework of the Artificial Neural Networks and Deep Learning course! You have the opportunity to test what you learned during the course and to compete with your classmates! ðŸ˜Ž

In this homework, you are asked to classify plants (like the ones in the example image below) that are divided into two categories according to their state of health. It is a binary classification problem, so the goal is to predict the correct class label in {0, 1}.
